MTree Enhanced Branch Editor

Replace the Normal Shader and the BranchEditor script inside MTree with the files from this repo/Enhanced Branch Editor\

Whats new?

- Texture Output Size: 512 / 1024 / 2048 / 4096
- Normal Input for Bark and Leaf Texture

Beware of following:

If the New Texture Output Size is above 1024 it can make the Editor Lag, and the time it takes to create a Texture will be increased.
